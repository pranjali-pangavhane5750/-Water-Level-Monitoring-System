💧 Automatic Water Level Monitoring System  

🚀 Project Overview:  
This project is an IoT-based Automatic Water Level Monitoring System that uses an ESP32, ultrasonic sensor, and LCD display to monitor and manage water levels in a tank. The system can automatically turn the water pump ON/OFF to prevent overflow or dry running, making it ideal for home automation, agriculture, and industrial applications.  

 Components Used:
- ESP32 (Microcontroller for processing & IoT connectivity)  
- Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) (For water level measurement)  
- LCD Display (16x2 / OLED) (To show water level in real-time)  
- 5V Battery / Power Supply (To power the system)  
- Water Pump (5V / 12V) (For automatic water management)  
- Water Source & Tank (To test the system)  
- Motor Driver (L298N / L293D) (To control the water pump)  

 🔧 How It Works:  
1. The Ultrasonic Sensor measures the distance between the sensor and the water surface.  
2. ESP32 processes the data and calculates the water level in the tank.  
3. Water level is displayed on the LCD screen.  
4. If the water level is low, ESP32 activates the motor driver to turn ON the pump and fill the tank.  
5. If the water level is high, ESP32 deactivates the motor driver to turn OFF the pump, preventing overflow.  
6. The system can also send alerts via IoT if required.  

📚 How to Set Up: 
1. Connect Components:  
   - ESP32 → Ultrasonic Sensor, LCD Display, Water Pump, Motor Driver.  
2. Upload the Code:  
   - Use Arduino IDE to program the ESP32.  
3. Power the System:  
   - Use a 5V battery or adapter to power the ESP32 and pump.  
4. Monitor Water Level:
   - Check the LCD display for real-time water levels.  

💡Future Improvements:  
✅ Add WiFi/Bluetooth to monitor levels remotely via an app.  
✅ Send alerts via Blynk or Firebase IoT.
✅ Optimize power consumption for longer battery life.
